    <p>You need to protect your iPhone from falls, scratches and its plain looking exterior. We've got the perfect cases for that. You want something unique and original that also gives you peace of mind if your prized possession were to accidently slip from your fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
    We want the same things. That is why we started Rocketcases. We wanted a case that was as cool as it was protective, so we set out to design the best. We'd never sell a case we wouldn't use ourselves.

    We say we're 'where the locals eat', but sometimes our summer visitors seem like locals too — they come back so often.
    </p>

    <p>
    We're close to that fabulous view of English Bay at the end of Denman and Davie Streets right in downtown Vancouver's West End district. We're on the corner of Denman and Comox Streets, so you can't miss us. And we have a great patio outside that you can enjoy during the warmer months — well, if you come early enough to claim a seat.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're planning to visit Vancouver, British Columbia in the next little while or you've just moved into the West End and are looking for a restaurant 'home' then make sure you drop in and see us, our food is always fresh and scrumptious and we'll give you a warm welcome.
