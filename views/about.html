  <h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The Bitcoin Co-op <!-- a registered co-operative association in the province of British Columbia.  We are --> is a democratic, voluntary association of individuals united by a mutual interest in bitcoin, a revolutionary digital currency and payment technology.  We support our members by negotiating discounts and deals with participating merchants, offering discounted rates on exchange, and supporting businesses that accept bitcoins by consulting with them on payment processing services and promoting them through our network.  We host regular events, meetups, hackathons and info sessions to bring people to bitcoin-friendly venues, build community, and raise awareness about the technology.</p>
